# Sparsify Image Classification Models Faster with SparseML and Deep Lake

[Deep Lake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake) by Activeloop is a deep learning deep lake that stores data in an optimized format for deep learning leading to fast loading when training models. The Deep Lake dataset format is optimized for rapid streaming and data querying when training models at scale.



[SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml) provides libraries for applying sparsification recipes to neural networks with a few lines of code, enabling faster and smaller models. SparseML does this while maintaining the model's accuracy. In this project, you will learn how to use Deep Lake and SparseML to sparsify an image classification model using ResNet.
