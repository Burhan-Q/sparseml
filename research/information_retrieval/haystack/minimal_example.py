    "Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer, songwriter and "
    "radio personality, who has been active in music for several decades. He gained "
    "worldwide fame in the 1980s, having multiple hits including his signature song "
    "Never Gonna Give You Up, Together Forever and Whenever You Need Somebody, and "
    "returned to music full-time in the 2000s after a 6-year hiatus. Outside his "
    "music career, Astley has occasionally worked as a radio DJ and a podcaster",

    "An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial "
    "neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, "
    "like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. "
    "An artificial neuron receives signals then processes them and can signal neurons "
    "connected to it. The signal at a connection is a real number, and the output of "
    "each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.",

    "Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 â€“ 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, "
    "sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult "
    "life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential painters of the 20th "
    "century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of "
    "constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide "
    "variety of styles that he helped develop and explore"
