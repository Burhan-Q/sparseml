# Dense Information Retrieval Integration with Elastic Search
Author: @spacemanidol
This folder contains information on how to leverage sparse Dense Information Retrieval methods with sparseml

To run any research projects, cd into the desired project's directory and install from the requirements.txt file using the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any issues are encountered, first try starting from a new virtual environment and install the requirements:
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

If there are continued issues, contact the author(s) indicated at the top of the README of each project's directory.

## Setup
### Elastic Search
First you will need to set up an active elastic search cluster. Instructions for how to do this can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/targz.html) and once installed can be run as shown below.
```bash
./bin/elasticsearch
```
